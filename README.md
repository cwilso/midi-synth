# MIDI Synth

This application is a analog synthesizer simulation built on the [Web Audio API](https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/audio/raw-file/tip/webaudio/specification.html).  It is very loosely based on the architecture of a [Moog Prodigy](http://www.vintagesynth.com/moog/prodigy.php) synthesizer, although this is a polyphonic synthesizer, and it lacks the oscillator sync and glide effects of the Prodigy.  (AKA: this is not intended to be a replication of the Prodigy, so pleased don't tell me how crappy a reproduction it is! :)

This uses my [Web MIDI Polyfill](https://github.com/cwilso/WebMIDIAPIShim) to add MIDI support via the [Web MIDI API](http://webaudio.github.io/web-midi-api/) - in fact, I partly wrote this as a test case for the polyfill and the MIDI API itself, so if you have a MIDI keyboard attached, check it out.  The polyfill uses Java to access the MIDI device, so if you're wondering why Java is loading, that's why.  It may take a few seconds for MIDI to become active - the library takes a while to load - but when the ring turns gray (instead of blue), it's ready.  If you have a native implementation of the Web MIDI API in your browser, the polyfill shouldn't load - but at the time of this writing, there are no such implementations.

Check it out, feel free to fork, submit pull requests, etc.
